# Week2-Project-Portfolio

## Description

This is a portfolio of the projects I worked on since I started my full stack developer journey. This began as a homework assignment to create a website portfolio that encapsulated what I learned after two weeks of Bootcamp: HTML and advanced CSS. I plan to keep updating and adding more features to my portfolio as I gain more knowledge and understanding of software development!

## Site Link

<a href="https://devinjl665.github.io/Week2-Project-Portfolio/#section-1">Deployed Site</a>

## Usage

Click on the buttons in the navigation bar to go to the corresponding section of the portfolio. Hover over the project thumbnails and click on the project you would like to see. 

## Credits

I referenced Anton Yosifov's github repository "Portfolio Template Lernantino" for reference when I got stuck or when I was trying to recreate the thumbnail layout. Repository is linked here: <a href="https://github.com/apyosi/Portfolio-Template-Lernantino">Anton's Portfolio Repository</a>

## User Story

As a bootcamp student I want to show a potential employer my deployed portfolio of work samples so that they can be reviewed and show my qualifications for an open position


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to have a sample of my previous work

WHEN I load my portfolio

THEN I am presented with my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work

THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the my first application

THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications

THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
